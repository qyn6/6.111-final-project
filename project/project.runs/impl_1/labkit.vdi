WARNING: [Drc 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net vga1024/vsync is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga1024/vsync_BUFG_inst_i_1/O, cell vga1024/vsync_BUFG_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [Drc 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT vga1024/vsync_BUFG_inst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 68 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:

    o/enabled_reg[7] {FDRE}
    o/enabled_reg[6] {FDRE}
    o/enabled_reg[5] {FDRE}
